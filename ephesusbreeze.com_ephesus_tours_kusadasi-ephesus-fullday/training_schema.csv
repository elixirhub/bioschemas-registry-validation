We made one adjustment and arranged to visit Sirince Village. We loved this quaint little village and were very happy to have made this choice. The ruins of Ephesus were fantastic. Selda, our tour guide gave us a wonderful account of the history and accommodated all our needs throughout the day. They took us to a carpet making store where they demonstrated how silk Turkish carpets are made.. Very interesting..    JuliaandLarry  Toronto, Canada', 'Ephesus Tours A+   10 out of 10,  Reviewed on 3 October 2013 We were on a cruise that stopped at Kusadasi Turkey and had booked a tour online. We were greeted on the pier by ""Betty"" and were taken by private car to the upper gate of Ephesus. Betty explained local history and landmarks on the way to Ephesus as well as walked with us through Ephesus. She was so knowledgeable and interesting. After Ephesus she took us to a rug ""college"" where we learned the weaving process and history, then had a typical Turkish meal that was delicious! Then we were returned to the pier with time to spare. I can\'t say enough about ""Betty"" and About Ephesus Tours! It was a fabulous experience.   Travel_Junkie9..  Minneapolis, Minnesota']"
