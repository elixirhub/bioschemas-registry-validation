I tried to fix it the very next day and they will not even talk to me and I'm the one that called and got the policy with them They do nothing to try and help you. They sure didn't have a problem taking my money. I would recommend using State Farm they have been wonderful !!! Will never use progressive again and that's if you can get them on the phone!"", ""I'm a young driver who has been with progressive for about 2 years. I was in a serious car accident about a year ago and to be blunt about it, progressive has been nothing but a nightmare.Progressive covered $5,000 in bills, which was awesome, however the lady I had to go through was just a plain jerk. It was almost like I was bothering her if I were to call with questions about my claim or needed assistance in getting this all done and over with.Here I am a year later STILL trying to pay off $25,000 in medical bill because they made this so difficult. I'm paying $379 a month in insurance and yet I'm constantly stressed with this company that makes me feel like I'm just a bother.I'm in the process of looking into another insurance company... It's sad that my family and I have been with them for so long that now I'm considering leaving.Don't get me wrong I do appreciate what they did do for me, but the lack of decent customer service, my bill, and the fact that it is taking this long to exhaust my $5,000 so that I can take this weight off my shoulders.It's a shame. I may stay, in hopes I am having just one bad experience."", 'Worst thing I could have ever done was switch to this company for homeowners insurance. They did a drive by and decided to cancel my policy because I wasn\'t ""keeping up"" the property. Granted my daughter had been in a horrible car accident and her non-operative vehicle was parked on the property but seriously is that any reason to cancel someone? After receiving notice and all their grips I addressed all issues that notated but they said there was nothing I could do I was fired. Truly awful experience!', ""Blamed me for everything saying that i started the accident.  Proved with documentation and statement saying that i was not at fault for accident.  Didn't help me with anything, and my case was tossed around in between 5 DIFFERENT CLAIMS REPS!  What company in their right mind would do that.  My case was handle for a little over a month now and i'm at a lost of words on how my claim was handle.  I'm done with this BS company and taking my other 2 cars out from their policy!!!!! Jeremy Morgan, Erika Javier, Meritza - You guys are extremely unhelpful.  Made senseless claims regarding my accident and antagonized me for asking questions!  Get out of the customer service industry and learn to treat people nicer!"", 'Process was smooth in Beginning Then was sent to Underwriting for Verification. After 2 days...they ask for Documentation which is ok....but they could have asked in the beginning ..Once you send them Documentation it takes them 2 more Business days to respond Supposedly Day 6...still Waiting..UNDERWRITING BLACKHOLE FAIL!!!!', 'Fresh news to Ohio drivers. Once again Progressive is raising our rates. Claiming rise in cost of business is the reason. Says it just to Ohio drivers only. Progressive is loosing two policies by raising my rates.

So long Flow and all your company\'s price hiking.', ""I was with progressive for at least 7 years with a flawless driving record.  They increased my payment every year, including my 25th birthday when males are supposed to get a large price reduction.  This led me to look around.

They said there was a claim against me ,  I told them that this was impossible  I didn't have any car accidents , so I asked them what was this claim about. They wanted me to give them my personal information in order to give me any information, so I tough that it doesn't make any sense and it was probably some kind of identity thief scam, and Of course I  didn't give them my personal information. well today I got another bill from a collection service for the same matter , I still don't know it this is some kind of scam ,  a joke ,are they just harassing people ?"", 'No insurance want policy holders to have accidents, that is understood.  But this is what insurance was created for!I am not an accident prone policy holder!', ""Do not go with progressive.... we had log truck insurance with them for a long time .A few years ago the rates doubled. The first excuse was a rate increase then it changed to a no fault accident, they did get that straight. Same thing this year , first excuse rate change for everyone.. then they said it was an accident.. the truck was all but sitting still when a mail carrier came flying around a corner, on the phone ( all against USPS regulations) and hit the rear of the log trailer... the state trooper said on the accident report it was the carriers fault... according to progressive an accident report is no more than a piece of paper....out of the stupidity of progressive they paid her $5000.00 and now my husband has a claim on his record.. we are changing all of our insurance to another company.. but will be paying more thanks to progressive... do not go with this company just in case through no fault of your own an idiot gets a knee scrape because they can't drive...it can go against you because progressive doesn't have any use for legal documents"", 'I switched my insurance to Progressive once I was convinced that it was a cheaper option. I used their slick website and online calculator tool to estimate what my rates would be, then used an online agent to buy the policy.The agent said he found more ""discounts"" that would save me tons and said they\'d be applied to my new policy. I paid the policy in full for all six months up front (or so I thought). 6 months later I go to renew the policy and find the rate has been hiked $60/month. I called for an explanation for the rate hike and they said, ""our rates are based on the markets and how dangerous a driver might be."" Great explanation...I ended up renewing with them, paying the newly hiked prices, and paying up front, in full, again. About 8 months later I got a notice from a collections agency that they were going to report a $110 charge to credit agencies. The charge was from Progressive. I called hoping to clear things up and they told me that I had lied to them and signed up for discounts that didn\'t apply, now I owe them the difference. The discounts were for a multi-policy plan, insuring multiple cars, and having a ""good student"" (none of which were true!!). Since they didn\'t apply to me the discounts had been reversed. HERE\'S WHERE THE SCAM COMES IN: I told the customer service woman that I didn\'t sign up for those, that one of their agents signed me up and added those discounts. Her reply was that, ""our agents always \'try\' to get you as many discounts as possible, but that sometimes THEY DON\'T ALWAYS WORK OUT."" She offered no further help or recourse and said she was happy to have me on record saying I acknowledge the charge and hung up on me.To me, this seems so dishonest that it constitutes fraud. As a company they hide behind rude, outsourced (outside the US) customer ""service"".I switched to a new company through a local agent and my rate is exactly half of what Progressive was charging and the coverage is nearly double.', ""If you don't know better they will try to get over on you! Will waste your time and will not properly inspect your vehicle in BR! They will do anything not to cover the damages on your vehicle....what's the point of insurance...and full coverage at that!!!"", 'After charging my bank acct for an automatic renewal of my motorcycle policy, I contacted them to say I no longer needed insurance and would just like a credit for the charge.  They asked for a sale date of my bike - NONE of their business, but I told them.  Next they ""canceled"" my insurance according to the sale of my bike.  That was 3 weeks earlier.  I never told them I wanted to cancel the current period.  They took it upon themselves to do that so they could charge me a $30 cancellation fee!!  HOW DARE THEM!!??  We are at the mercy of these fools running these companies that are ruthless!!', ""Don't waste your money or time with this company. You never know how good is your insurance until the day you actually need it. And this was the worse experience ever. Do yourself a favor and don't get attracted for lower prices. If you ever get into an accident they will only repair the cheapest parts, the rest they will tell you that was already damaged prior the accident."", 'My wife had Progressive for her car insurance for a few years. A few months after we were married, we decided to combine our plans, and we got a much better quote with All State. She calls, cancels her policy (which she never had to use), and they tell her that everything would be fine - just sign the letter they send, and she\'d get money back. That was 3 months ago. She receives the letter, signs and returns it. She gets an email saying she has a payment due. She calls, confirms it\'s not actually due. They say don\'t worry about it, it just is saying that because of paperwork delay. Next month, there is ANOTHER payment due! She calls again. They say ""oh, we have flagged the account to make sure it\'s taken care of. It\'s a processing error. Check back in 24 hours."" She calls back in 2 days. Same story, but this time it will take 1-2 weeks. She calls after a week, and they still are claiming a processing error. Now the account is ready to be sent to collections! And she canceled the policy, and THEY owe HER money!After days of calling over and over again, it STILL is not fixed! We\'re in the process of purchasing a house, have 800+ credit scores, and there is a potential that their incompetence can send this bill to collections and affect her credit. This is absolutely unbelievable. I will never recommend them. I had Geico before we switched, and it was a super simple process for me to switch. Progressive\'s customer service is awful, and they don\'t seem to know how to get anything done. We\'ve been trying to take care of this for months! And worst part is that it\'s US chasing down THEM for THEIR error!', 'I chose Progressive as my first car insurance policy. I had never owned a car prior to this and I barely use the car.Unfortunately, my window was broken about two months into my policy. I submitted a claim and had the window fixed.Once the claim was submitted, I was sent emails by Progressive with various requests for different types of proof on various issues. I truly believe that this was punitive because I had submitted a claim. I would never recommend Progressive and I found the same exact coverage at a quarter of the price with Geico.', ""I have been a progressive policy holder since 2005 on motorcycles and boats. Will be canceling all policies this week. Another progressive policy holder backed into my truck causing major damage to bedside panel and progressive assumed liability, that's great, however I have been battling them for a month now on fixing my vehicle. Their crook adjusters are unwilling to replace the bed side which five different body shops (including two progressive preferred shops) all say it needs to be replaced not repaired. Today the adjuster called and told me a Bold Face Lie that my body shop said it could be repaired (they did not) then tried to pressure me to let them fix it. Moral of the story they are currently treating a long term customer which has spent thousands with them with no claims like trash. Beware! if they treat their loyal customers like this how do the treat non customers during claim work? Very disappointed with this company."", ""I've been paying homeowners since I purchased my house in '02..never missed a payment. I switched to progressive because farmers raised their rates and a friend liked them. My house burned down three days ago and I just found out they cancelled my policy without telling me 6 months ago. They claim to have notified my mortgage company, but they have no record. Nor did I ever receive certified mail and they cannot show me any proof they tried to make contact on a policy I had set up as an automatic withdrawal..as I always do. Once a year. So I'm screwed. I've lost everything and they'd like to reinstate the policy.I think not."", 'They charge you a restocking fee if you cancell.But they dont tell you that when you order there insurance they scam.If you dont pay they put it on your credit record.So ask if you cancell will you be charged a extra fee', 'I opted to place my insurance with Progressive, so I could have a local agent. (I had previously been with GEICO for three years.) However, I discovered a $25.00 ""application fee"" which had not been disclosed to me when I purchased the policy.I telephoned the Progressive company to learn why I had been charged a $25.00 ""application fee"" and the first person was very rude, saying it was charged by all insurance companies, and that he was sure the agent had told me about it before I purchased the policy. I asked to speak with his supervisor and the supervisor was even more rude than the first man I spoke with.I called the agent, Donna Newsome, and she was very rude to me as well, saying it is ""standard practice"" to collect a $25.00 ""application fee.""GEICO has never charged me any hidden fees, including this ""application fee."" And GEICO staff has always been very friendly and helpful. The tragedy is that GEICO is also less expensive than Progressive.I\'m sorry I ever changed insurance carriers in the first place, and I\'ll be headed back to GEICO at first opportunity.', ""I've reported to the BBB in Cleveland for Fraudulent and Unfair practice. I purchased the policy in October 15, 2014. I've signed the online exclusion form since my other driver already had a full covered policy from another insurance also covering whatever vehicle the person may drive. I waited for the hardcopy to arrive and never got it. In January 20, Progressive took out $451.35 from my bank account without my permission and ended up in hardship because of negative deficit from my bank, Progressive claimed they had to cover insurance for excluded driver for the duration since they did not receive any form of signature and would not reimburse it to the bank and claimed I still needed to make my monthly. I only gave them permission for monthly payment to cover an old 2004 Honda which doesn't cost but $300-$400 for a 6 month policy. I cancelled the policy that night. Took two days for my Bank Agent to reverse it after reporting for Fraud. But for the Two Days, I was without Insurance because of Progressive intimidating tactic to make you keep the auto insurance. Don't LET THEM FULL YOU!"", 'This April I purchase insurance through my agent. I paid for a year in cash and the agent wrote me up with Progressive. After only two months, I sold the motorcycle and canceled the policy. Progressive charged a $30 dollar cancellation fee and returned 50% of the price a paid for a year. After calling to see if they made a mistake, I dealt with a frustrating phone call trying to get past the computer that did not recognize mt policy number. I finally got through to a person that was difficult to understand and could care less about my concerns.It is obvious that Progressive is only concerned with profit, not people.', 'I REGRET HAVING DONE BUISNESS WITH PROGRESSIVE INSSURANCE.I use them to insure my motorcycle for about a year when out of the blue they razed my already high rates. So I moved to another company. My agent drug his feet canceling with progressive and they draft my account for another month. I request a refund and they sent me only $8!!!!!!!  AVOID Progressive!', 'Long story short... Progressive was happy to help us get set up with Homesite who was the underwriter. When a hailstorm came in 2011 and everyone else had help with their companies, we were told our roof, which was barely hanging on, was fine and they would give us $350. to fix what???? we dealt with crappy reps like Ruby Johnson, Perry Lust, and even wrote to the CEO of Progressive, Glenn Renwick who did not have the time or balls to respond. Mind you, it took forever just to get someone on the phone to begin with. We had to demand to speak to managers before anyone would even call us. Wish I had done my homework better because there are countless complaints out there just like this. Horrible customer service and no integrity. I would suggest take your business to a more reputable company!!', 'They want me to pay for all repairs and then see if they will pay me back.

It is like they want you to get a Lawyer involved.', ""It's too bad there is no way to give this company zero stars. I had Progressive for over 20 years before I needed to file a claim with them. Though their customer service had always been less than friendly and professional, they assigned 100% fault to the other driver. A month later they assigned the other driver 0% fault though there was no new information to justify the reversal. When I asked for an explanation, they were evasive and hostile. I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy. I now pay half of what my Progressive rates were for more comprehensive coverage with State Farm, so it did turn out for the best. I only wish that I'd switched sooner.Progressive may have cute commercials, but their prices are not competitive and they do not deserve your business."", 'Left my old insurance co. because Progressive was cheaper.

Will be leaving Progressive ASAP!', 'After finding cheaper insurance, and had been trying to talk with progressive on how to reduce my monthly costs, I finally decided to look elsewhere, and low and behold, I found a policy half the price! When I called Progressive to cancel, they asked why I was cancelling, the representative had said "" I see you have been doing some shopping around""...then after going through the routine questions, I was hit with a cancellation fee, taking what I should have been reimbursed for paying the month already, and an outstanding balance would be sent in the mail to me.(after I already cancelled) After the call ended, and talking with my new insurance company, they informed me that they RARELY almost never hear of a cancellation fee and should not be the case...So I decided to call back Progressive. The representative that I spoke to was NOT helpful, knowing I had just cancelled...said ""what was the reason why you cancelled?"" I told her and she said the reason might be the case for cancellation fee! Then after going into her speal the cancellation fee is in my contract, PG 28.

AVOID PROGRESSIVE at ALL COSTS!', ""I first purchased Progressive's home insurance because they gave me a great initial quote for my home. In the past 6 years the renewal quotes have steadily creep-ed up. My quote price is now $400.00 more than it was 6 years ago.Here's the kicker. I finally called Progressive to see why my rate kept increasing, as I have not and probably never would file a claim. The lady explained it was because of the recent hurricanes impacting the State of New Jersey! I don't live in that state or anywhere near the coast!To help me out she stated that she would update my policy and hopefully get a rate reduction.

Poor communication and services.', 'Have been a Progressive customer for 14 years and absolutely love the customer service. Although we have never had a claim, my wife and I have both been involved in accidents and Progressive stepped up and took great care of us. My issue is the fact we have full coverage, no accidents, great credit, no tickets, and have been with them for 14+ years, but they feel it is acceptable to increase my premium by 10% every six months. I have fought off the urge to get other quotes for the last 2 years, but after receiving my latest premium notice it is obvious that I am single handedly paying for all the Flo ads.', ""My motorcycle was rear-ended and they denied the claim even though I had pictures of their DUI insured's smashed car. State Farm was great and paid the claim. State Farm Didn't sue Progressive so I represented myself sued Progressive and won.    Another one of their insured backed out in a parking lot damaging the entire right side of my daughter's Mustang as she drove past.

Looking forward to taking them to court and winning again."", ""I was with Progressive for five years or more. I went online to take off my automated bill payment, and somehow accidentally cancelled my policy. Sounds ridiculous, yes i know, but Progressive was not helpful at all. They wouldn't let me reinsate my original policy, work with me, or get me back to the rate I was at, even though I was a premium customer. The lady I spoke with was not friendly or helpful. She said she spoke to the manager and there was absolutely nothing they could do to help. Although this doesn't sound awful, it's just surprising that they wouldn't want to try and keep a loyal customer. Ive worked in the insurance field for a few years and this was just surprising to me and poor customer service.

I called and was told it was my credit rating.  1- I had opened/closed accounts and 2- I had not opened a car loan in over 10 yrs.  So, the fact that my mother died an I closed accounts and opened estate accounts and moved to a bank more convenient meant that I was at a greater risk of filing a claim.  I was told yes.  I paid cash for a 2008 Mercedes and that also made me a risk for filing claims  I was told yes and also told ""someone else could have bought the car for me"".   I have cost Progressive  one windshields in the last 12 years. So much for loyalty.

I made my first payment, and recently after, received a letter stating that my plan had gone up six bucks due to a move.  That made no sense, since we now had more secure parking, and I moved a mile literally.  So I call and speak to Becky.  She transfers me to Cassandra who is supposed to help me look for discounts to offset the new increase.  Cassandra sees I have renters insurance with progressive as well.  She then says she will be honest with me, and that since I already have the renters insurance discount, California doesn't really have any other discounts.  She doesn't check anything else to see if she can save me money.  I ask if I have to call to cancel the plan.  She tells me I do, and that if I cancel before six months, I will incurr a $50 cancellation charge.  I don't really understand that.  I agreed to the first price they gave me in March, not the inflated price I received after making my first payment.  They basically bait & switched.  They amended our contract after I'd already agreed to the contract by making a payment."", 'They started out giving me a good rate but after I made a change to my policy they wanted to charge me I think around 150 a month for liability on one vehicle so I got some other quotes and told them I was going to cancel then they brought down my premium so I stayed with them. I just recently bought a newer truck and when I told them I wanted to get full coverage on it they told me my monthly payments were going to be over 300 a month for full coverage on one vehicle which is almost as much as my truck payments.

After incessant demands for information from us, and despite exact matching damage and conflicting stories from Progressive's insured owner, the company denied our claim.  This unethical company also based estimates on a different jurisdiction to lower it's payout and avoid payment for sales tax.

All drivers and insurers, particularly of multi lines, special and RVs, beware Progressive's alliance with criminals to steal your resources and leave you without a vehicle when you most need it."", ""I emailed and called to have my policy cancelled.

This turned a $2400 repair in to an unrepairable $13K loss (minimum if I can find a engineless glider as with any classic car the loss can be anything based on current demand), which Liberty refused to pay and Progressive said they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re not liable for nor will they defend me.  (What ever happened to full coverage?).  Liberty offered $800 for the damages. During this time in March / 2011 a major storm hit my area.  The storm caused $38000 in damages to my house, which Progressive graciously paid a wonderful $9000. In the 12 years with I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve been with Progressive these were the first real claim with them.  I saved probably about $5000 in comparison to others and spent ~12,200 in premiums.  They couldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t even equal what they had collected.

I was a good customer no accidents or tickets since I have been a licensed driver and I am 60 years old and have been driving since I was 18. I only had liability insurance with this company because I have an older car. My premiums started out $54.00 per month and remained that way for about two years. However about 2 months ago my premium went up by $21.00. I called the company and asked why my premium went up when I am a good driver and never had accidents or tickets. They tried to give me an explanation having to do with when the company in general takes losses it will sometimes increase customer premiums. In other words, I was penalized because of some of their other customers who were bad drivers. Well I wish they would have told me that when I first became a customer. Long story short I found a company offering a better rate and I cancelled my insurance in a timely manner and paid my premium to them as scheduled.  Now they are charging me a cancellation fee and some other bogus charge. Instead of increasing my premium I should have received a decrease because of my driving record. I am thinking about taking them to court on this matter because they are penalizing me for going with a different company. I would not advise anyone to do business with them.', 'I was rearended and when I took my car to the service center for a quote.

Having the same coverage  i was expecting to pay the same amount of money. But for my ranger i was paying more than my Chevy . Asking why the difference in price ( difference is was 200$ more than chevy ) i was told this : RANGERS are causing more accidents on the road than any other car. Like the Rangers are driving themselves on the road without a driver. Is the driver or the car causing the accidents? For them it seem to be the truck causing the accidents.  Anyhow, i told them  BYE BYE  and i got a better rate ( half than what i was paying with Progressive ) with other company.  Only thing i regret is the fact that i have spent so many years with them overpaying  for car insurance.  DO NOT BELIEVE THEIR ADVERTISING ON TV OR RADIO.', ""Progressive doesn't think so.  I was in an auto accident in July of 2011 and Progressive has not paid my medical bill, 8 months later.

DO NOT GIVE THIS COMPANY YOUR MONEY, use any other insurance company, they have treated me badly, they will not treat you any better."", 'On 6/22/2012 I sent Progressive my account information so they could start debiting my checking account for my home owners policy, which in an e-mail stated it would be a total of $889.00 annually paid with a $149.00 down and $74 for the next 10 months.  On  6/23/12 I received an confirmation e-mail that my policy was in effect and that they would begin debiting my account, so I cancelled my Allstate policy which was costing me $1900.00 annually for the same coverage.  On 7/06/12 I received a cancellation notice from Progressive for failure to pay and that in order to have it reinstated I would have to pay a years  premium in advance. I called Progressive who after investigating the situation found out that although I sent them the correct account information Progressive entered my checking account incorrectly and therefore the debit they sent to my bank was declined.  Because of their mistake I had no homeowners insurance from 6/23/2012 thru 7/06/2012. Progressive told me that it was their mistake and that they would take care of it. About an hour later I received an e-mail from the women I spoke with stating that it was their fault and that they have reinstated my policy at a higher price. The new charge would be $162 for the first two months and $81.97 for the next 10 months.  Not only did I not have homeowners insurance for two weeks but once they found out it was their fault, instead of giving me a better price for my trouble, they increased the premium by $100.00.

Luckily, baby and I survived but my nearly 10 year old Toyota Corolla with over 100K miles on it was severely damaged.  I had been preparing to sell it just that weekend - had just spent over $300 on it.  Although the damage assessed amounted to more than 90% of the Kelly Blue Book value on the car, Progressive refused to total it - putting a few hundred dollars over retaining a 5 year customer and making good on their plan.  Moreover, when I then reviewed other companies, I found that the rate they'd been charging me, WITHOUT rental coverage, was well above what any of the other major insurance companies quoted.  Progressive THEN charged me a $50 cancellation fee.  Horrible experience.  They're are not on the side of their insured."", 'I\'ve been with Progressive for 11 years and after I filed two minor claims (not my fault) I learned that the fancy ""Emerald"" status and some kind of priority queue when calling mean absolutely nothing and are just gimmicks to make you feel valued and loyal. After a gross mishandling by Progressive of a minor claim I became worried about how would Progressive handle a major claim, if one was to happen. I finally took the plunge and cancelled my Policy with Progressive.  They were hardly even interested in the reasons for my cancellation.  I was relieved to see how easy it was to get another policy with a much better company.  10 minutes into a flawless online application process I was printing the new USAA insurance cards for a better coverage at a lower price, and from a company with much higher consumer rating than Progressive.

I have never been late on anything and they are raising my rates based not on my driving record (perfect), or on vehicles (old), or on claims (none) but on something not related at all to my ability to function as a safe, loyal driver.  Because I bought a house in 2009 and have 3 credit cards (Kohls, Homedepot, Chase) I am being punished by Progressive for using credit I am qualified for and pay off quite regularly.  So Progressive's thinking is:  if the client is stretched out a little in credit, lets charge them more so the hole can get deeper.

This lady and her friend came running out of the car and beating on my car threatening to beat me up. We called the cops and that's when we knew things were going downhill the driver was claiming to be an fbi agent and then told the police we caused her to bump into the car in front of her. Both ladies denied medical help. I gave my insurance information and then went home. Progressive never came out to take pictures and only went and looked at her car. We hear nothing more about it till may of this year when Progressive calls and states that the driver and her passenger are suing progressive for injuries. Well I no longer have that car or progressive in the first place. Next I found out that they paid the driver 3,000 dollars for a cracked tail light because there may or may not have been damage to the front of her car. The pictures we took show damage to the front of her car on the passenger side, where she or another car would have had to hit it. It does not show damages relayed to a front end collision. Long story short, we are still in the process of this mess because they just want to pay them to go away even though it is clearly fraud and they refuse to investigate it.

It did not all happen at once; my rate went up $100/month after an accident 6 months after starting the policy & then $200/month after what would've been the 3rd year with them!!  The most infuriating thing was that the last six months I had been using Snapshot & had been Extremely cautious so that I could get a better rate.  The status on the site told me I was eligible for a 20% discount, making the monthly payment go down from 200-160!  Instead at renewal they told me it would be going up to $400 due to two fender benders.  I immediately found a better rate & canceled.  So much for customer loyalty.

Progressive called me and basically said they were going to pay him $516 before EVER sending someone out to look at his car, or even look at pictures. I felt like they were working against me and I was shocked at how easy they decided they were going to pay this other person.

They would not even offer to cover a portion of the damage even though it was CLEARLY due to high wind and rain, not age. I continue to complain to management, the BBB, the state insurance division, and others. But progressive continues to come up with excuses for their position. There are only two excuses: 1) Greed, 2) The policy is worthless.Of course the roof had a little age. It is a 1992 Winnebago. They knew the age of the roof, yet GLADLY took the high premiums every year.

The representative said that I needed to meet with their claim agent and they would write the estimate. They wrote the estimate for 40% less then the two other body shops. Just doesn't seem like they deal in good faith."", ""I've had a car accident where I'm 0% responsible and the other driver had AAA insurance. After blackmails, they have stolen my car (I'm not their client}, and did a lot of criminal and federal offenses like fraud, scam, theft, blackmail, perjury, corruption, obstruction of justice. Even my own insurance, Progressive, covered up their offenses by erasing my complaint at CHP... I filed a federal complaint against more than 30 persons. You can read it by searching by google granier vs ladd, A lot of time lost, waste to fight those FuBa, even protected by California Department of Insurance, Dave Jones its commissioner and the governor, Jerry Brown. California means Banana Republic. Not a state of United States..."", 'NEVER HAD ANY PROABLEMS EXCELLENT SERVICES', 'Every year rate went up about 100.00 with no explanation. This year it jumped from 1500 to 6255.00!!!!!! Not a single claim ever. They told me its because of claims in my town. WTH!?  Then I find out it is actually because when my dad\'s home burned and the family discussed insurance I was curious about my coverage. I called progressive and explained that and asked about my coverage. I gave examples like ""what if my house burned?"" ""what if a tornado hit?"" ""what if the roof fell in?"" I was informed by a different agency that my call caused that review and the ""insurance risk factor"" to occur. So I canceled and here I sit waiting for a check for 5600.00 to come to me and they\'ve promised it has been mailed TWO weeks ago and still NO check. worst ever. I have reported them to the Department of insurance and my legislature. Damn con artist.', 'I have not gotten any information', 'They are the best in price far as I can see.', 'The only problem I had with them was how they took out my payment every 30 days, rather than a specific day each month.', 'Always cost efficient and easy to do business with. Have multiple policies with them. Would continue doing business with them but I always like to shop around.', 'company no longer providing coverage in Florida', 'would go back to them', 'Would definitely recommend to a friend.', 'We are having a hard time to find a company who will insure a tied down,skirted destination trailer with a newly built 12x18 sunroom attached..', 'They take at least 6 months to pay a claim & even then they negotiate it down so they only pay 20% of it.In addition,every 30 days they ask for another piece of unneccessary paperwork. Terrible- huge Rip-Off.', 'Long story short. I was not at fault for 3 accidents, all three claims representatives told me I was not at fault. Progressive still payed out the other party without my knowledge or decency to inform me. I will be canceling soon. I pay close to 100 with progressive. I just called GEICO and they said my insurance will be $34 dollars with them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I cant believe I wasted all this time. Call GEICO. Progressive will pick pocket you and find a way to justify their actions.', 'have not seen anything yet', 'We are very satisfied with Progressive Insurance Company for our auto insurance. Have been doing business with our agent for at least ten years.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"
